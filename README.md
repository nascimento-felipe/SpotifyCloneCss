# SpotifyCloneCss
 ### Description:

   - This is a Spotify Web clone that I'm doing to improve my css skills ans my js skills. 
   - The ideia is to do a website with login and signup, not make a music app. Maybe after this I do a mobile app and try to make something like a music player.
   - Feel free to use to study or get new ideias from it.
   
### How to use:
1. Clone this repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nascimento-felipe/SpotifyCloneCss
```

2. Use the "yarn dev" script to run the server.
* The server is used only to create a user in the database, if u are not going to use it, u can just ignore this.

### Development:
* Server:
- Server is not registering new users.

* Web
- The sign up page is with no css.
- The sign in/sign up pages aren't working.
- Premium page is not full complete.
